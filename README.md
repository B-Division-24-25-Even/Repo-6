##  Identifying the Objectives
- Efficiency  
- Real-Time Monitoring  
- Easy To Use  
- Plant Safety  
- Cost Effective  

---

###  **Problem Definition Version 1**
> The plucking bot should be **efficient**, **user-friendly**, and **cost-effective**.  
> It should not damage plants while plucking fruits and should support **real-time monitoring**.

---

##  Identifying The Functions
- Target Identification  
- Communication  
- Operational Modes  
- Target Navigation  

---

###  **Problem Definition Version 2**
> The plucking bot should be **efficient**, **user-friendly**, and **cost-effective**.  
> It should not damage the plant while plucking fruits and should support **real-time monitoring**.  
> It should be able to do **Target Navigation** and **Target Identification**.  
> It should work **autonomously** and should connect to a mobile app for easy control.

---

##  Identifying The Constraints
- Good Battery Life  
- Light-Weight  
- Transportation of Fruits  
- Dimensions  
- Low Maintenance  
- Suitable for Different Weather  

---

###  **Problem Definition Version 3**
> The plucking bot needs to be **affordable**, **user-friendly**, and **durable** enough to withstand different weather conditions so it can operate smoothly in various environments.  
> It should work **autonomously**, provide **real-time monitoring**, and connect to a **mobile app for easy control**.  
> The bot must be able to **identify**, **navigate**, and **pluck** targets efficiently while being gentle on plants to **prevent damage**.  
> However, there are some limitations—it will have a **battery life of 3–4 hours**, **weigh up to 4 kgs**, and may not function perfectly in **extreme weather conditions**. Additionally, it should be **low-maintenance** to reduce the need for frequent repairs.
